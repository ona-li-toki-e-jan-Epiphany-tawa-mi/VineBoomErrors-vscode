# Change Log

- Initial release

## [Unreleased]

- Switched from play-sound to find-exec for playing audio files as play-sound didn't offer much in terms of functionality, and most of what it offered had to be overwritten anyways.
- Added ability to configure which audio players to use.
- Added ability to configure what arguments are used with which audio players.
- Configuration changes are now loaded live and only one remains that still requires reloading.
- Added ability to configure at which error severity level to play the Vine boom.
